# SugarMonitoring

This project is one of the first few projects that I have worked on as a beginner developer and it is coded in PHP. I used XAMPP to run and host my application on a Apache server (localhost) along with an MySQL database which stores the data entered on the website. 

<h2> So what exactly is this application all about? </h2>

Basically, it is an application that allows users to monitor and record down their blood sugar levels to determine whether they are at risk of getting illnesses due to a high blood sugar level.

Users are given the option to register an account on the website and they are able to view their inputted values which are displayed neatly in a formatted table. These values are checked and compared against a fixed set of variables which determines their risk level.
